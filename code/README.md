# Sign recognition with Pytorch CNN

The aim of this project is to train a model with Pytorch to identify signs of one to ten. The code of data processing and model training is shown in SIGN_REG.ipynb

Original data can be found at https://github.com/MEICLabFZU/Gesture-Recognition-based-on-IMU

### Update:

The training with supplementary data is updated in SIGN_REG-with_new_data.ipynb. It also changed slightly on CNN layers, that dropout layer is removed.
