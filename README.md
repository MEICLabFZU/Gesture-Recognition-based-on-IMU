## The project is applying for a patent, we will upload our project's code later

**You can get the data in folder name is data. The database includes two parts. One part is the original data collected from 10 participants with three groups of data of each gesture, a total of 300 groups of data(rawdata). The other part is obtained by the scaling for the relative position and value of the data as well as by translation and etc.**

## The data-file name is A-B-C-D.txt represent the sensor's location, gesture means, data categories, and count of data.
